# Simple-JavaCalc
The simplest Java Calculator

Welcome!

This is my second GitHub project and my first open-sourced java project I've ever released.

## Why open-source?
I wanted to create something very useful and easy just to show developers like me how something so simple could seem hard.
But at the end it pays off no matter how you look at it.

## Functionality
Basically, how it works is how every simple calculations are made; 2 numbers and an operand (+,-,/,* or x) which is how this script interprets any calculations you give it.
If you wanted to do a continuous calculation then the script automatically replaces the first number as the previous result after the operand is selected again.
### Keyboard Support Added
Now you could enter the numbers through the keyboard and use the same operands to do calculations. (Equal/Result button not supported)
